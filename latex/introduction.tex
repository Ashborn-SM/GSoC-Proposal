\section{Project Overview}

This project aims to develop an open-source, interactive tool for designing and analyzing sensor arrays within \acf{gr}, it is inspired by MATLABâ€™s \href{https://in.mathworks.com/products/phased-array.html}{Phased Array System Toolbox} (more specifically: \href{https://in.mathworks.com/help/phased/ref/sensorarrayanalyzer-app.html}{Sensor Array Analyzer}). This \acs{gui}-based tool should allow users to configure various array parameters, visualize the array-factor in different plots, view performance characteristics and play around with popular Beamforming and \acf{doa} estimation algorithms.

Once the design is complete, the tool should generate a compatible \ac{gr} flow graph, configured with the chosen array settings. This functionality bridges the gap between array design and real-time testing, empowering researchers and engineers to iterate and test their designs seamlessly in \ac{gr}.

By creating this tool, the project seeks to provide the open-source community with a powerful, accessible alternative to proprietary software, lowering the barrier to entry for advanced array processing research and development.
	
\section{Motivation}

When I first started as an intern, I was tasked with developing adaptive array algorithms. At the time, my understanding of signal processing was very limited, and working with multi-dimensional signal processing algorithms was really a daunting task. The first major hurdle was grasping the mathematical foundations and intuition behind the algorithms. After extensive effort, I was able to develop a good understanding of most concepts.

The next challenge was implementation and verification. While searching for simulation tools, I found that MATLAB was the primary option, but being paid-license based, I was unable to use it. This left me with no choice but to develop everything from scratch. At that time, my programming experience was limited, making the process even more difficult. I looked online for array processing algorithm implementations to get a sense of how they were implemented. Although there were only a handful of resources available, I managed to find a couple of GitHub repositories and \href{https://pysdr.org/}{PySDR}, which proved to be invaluable. They helped me with signal generation, algorithm implementation, pattern visualization, and even understanding the underlying theory. However, they primarily focused on \acf{ula}, making it quite tricky to do the same for planar arrays. Through extensive study of textbooks and careful adaptation of available resources, I was eventually able to extend the simulation to planar array.

While I gained a lot from developing everything from scratch, it was also time-intensive and prone to errors. Developing the core algorithm is one aspect, but implementing signal generation, visualization tools and all the other supporting tools, just adds significant overhead. This project aims to simplify these aspects, allowing researchers and engineers to focus on algorithm development rather than spending excessive time on auxiliary tasks.

This is a proposal for a project that seeks to create a tool for designing and analyzing sensor arrays in GNU Radio. The tool will feature a user-friendly GUI to configure array parameters, visualize patterns and experiment with various built-in array processing algorithms. It will also generate \acf{gr} flow graphs based on the user-defined parameters, enabling seamless transition from design to real-time testing withing the GNU Radio. This project strives to make advanced array processing more accessible, fostering exploration and innovation without relying on proprietary software.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Array Response}: A \acs{gr} block that receives multiple input signals and outputs $N$ phase-shifted versions of the superimposed signal based on the steering vector.
	\item \textit{Steering Vector}: A \ac{gr} block that can be configured to generate phase delays based on the array configurations.
	\item \textit{Beamforming}: A \ac{gr} block that takes in $N$ phase-shifted signals and apply popular beamforming algorithms.
	\item \textit{\acs{doa} Estimation}: A \ac{gr} block  popular that takes in $N$ phase-shifted signals and applies \ac{doa} estimation algorithms.

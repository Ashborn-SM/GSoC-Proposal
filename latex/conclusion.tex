%Apart from my personal details, I began my coding journey in high school, starting with simple game development, one of my first projects was a Flappy Bird clone. Later, I got interested in computer vision and deep learning. I even built a computer vision project that's available on my GitHub, feel free to check it out.
%
%As my interest grew, I wanted to dive deeper into the math behind it all. But that’s when things got overwhelming, at the time all the concepts were too complex for me, I mean barely understood calculus back then. Eventually, I stepped away from computer vision because it felt too advanced for me back then.
%
%As i started college I explored many diverse filed like blockchain, android development, machine learning, web development etc and eventually started doing data structures and algorithms which was super important during job interviews. And as i got got better at it, I started to contributing to a repository mainly for open-source beginners, my contributions to the repo can be found \href{https://github.com/MakeContributions/DSA/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+assignee%3AAshborn-SM+}{\textit{here}}.

%And as things progressed

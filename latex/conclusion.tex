\section{Timeline}

This \acs{gsoc} project schedule spans over 22 weeks, from June-2 to November-10. The minimum guaranteed time spent per week roughly is,
$$ 3 \text{ hours} \times 6 \text{ days} + 1.5 \text{ hours on sunday} = 19.5 \frac{\text{hours}}{\text{week}}$$

The total time spent on the project,
$$ 3 \text{ hours} \times 6 \text{ days} \times 22 \text{ weeks} + 1.5 \text{ hours on sunday} \times 22 \text{ weeks} = 429 \text{ hours}$$

I am willing to put additional hours on holidays if necessary.

\section{A note to the mentors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I am not a student but a full-time employee.
	\item For the interactions/communications with the mentors, it can be through g-mail, google-meet etc.
	\item This isn't my first open-source contributions. I started my journey way back in 2020 but had to stop for various reasons. Here's my previous contributions:  \href{https://github.com/MakeContributions/DSA/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+assignee%3AAshborn-SM+}{https://github.com/MakeContributions/DSA}
	\item For demonstrating my coding capabilities, here's the \href{https://github.com/Ashborn-SM/GSoC-Proposal/blob/main/plots.ipynb}{\textit{link}} to .ipynb file which contains the code for the various pattern plots seen in chapter \ref{ch: application-window}. The 3-D pattern seen in the title page is the array factor of the weights computed using \ac{lcmv}, which is also present in that file.
	\item The first two months of the timeline may look overcrowded but couple of them are already implemented in the .ipynb I shared in the above point. And also, I have experience developing couple of other Beamforming and \ac{doa} estimation algorithms in my work. So, in my opinion, it should not be taking any longer than what is projected for the completion of the project.
\end{itemize}
